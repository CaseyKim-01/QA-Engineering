# What is Software Testing? 

## Definition
- A process used to identify correctness/completeness, and quality of developed softwares
- Intended to find errors before the software gets released to the end-users
- "Check if it is defect-free"

## Importance
<p>
Software Testing is important because bugs are dangerous. If we don't test in all possible scenarios, we might confront unexpected bugs that can lead to human/financial loss

## Testing Principles
1. Testing shows the presence of defects

2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
  \t- We should come up with optimal amount of testing based on risk assessment
  - The scenario where there is a higher risk of bugs, create more test cases on that

3. Defect Clustering
  - Defects are not uniformly distributed
  - Rather, they are concentrated on small number of modules

4. Early Testing 
  - Testing should start early in the SDLC (Software Developement Life Cycle)

5. Pesticide Paradox
  - Should review/revise test cases regularly to come up with new cases to test the bugs
  - "repeated same test cases --> decrease the chance of discovering new bugs"

6. Testing is context dependent
  - depends on what we are testing 

7. Absence of errors - fallacy
  - user's want should not be ignored just because we want to remove all errors
